# Decentralized Voting Smart Contract for Arch Network

## Overview
This repository contains a Rust-based smart contract that implements a decentralized voting system on the Arch network. The contract allows users to create polls with customizable options, securely cast a single vote per wallet, and close polls automatically after the specified voting period ends. It emphasizes transparency, security, and gas efficiency for on-chain voting.

## Features
- **Poll Creation:** Create voting polls with a custom question and selectable options.
- **Secure Voting:** Enforces one vote per wallet to prevent double-voting using on-chain checks.
- **Real-Time Tallying:** Votes are tallied as they are cast, enabling up-to-date result displays.
- **Time-Bound Voting:** Polls have clearly defined start and end times; they can be automatically or manually closed once voting is complete.
- **Access Control:** Only authorized users (such as the poll creator) can close polls and manage administrative tasks.

## Project Structure
- **Cargo.toml:** Project manifest with dependencies and crate configurations.
- **src/**
  - `lib.rs`: Main source file containing the smart contract logic for poll creation, vote casting, and poll closure.
- **tests/**
  - Contains unit tests covering core functionality and edge cases.
- **README.md:** This documentation file.
- **.gitignore:** List of files and directories to ignore (e.g., build artifacts).

## Prerequisites
- **Rust:** Ensure you have Rust installed (preferably the latest stable version).
- **Arch Network SDK/Crates:** Include the `arch-program` crate as required.
- **Borsh:** Used for serialization and deserialization.

## Getting Started

### Installation & Build
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voting_smart_contract.git
   cd voting_smart_contract
   ```
2. Build the project in release mode:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

### Running Tests
Run the unit tests to ensure everything functions as expected:
```bash
cargo test
```

## Usage
1. **Creating a Poll:**
   - Use the `CreatePoll` instruction to set up a new poll with a question, options, start time, and end time.
2. **Voting:**
   - Submit the `Vote` instruction specifying the option index. The contract ensures each wallet can only vote once.
3. **Closing a Poll:**
   - Once the voting period is over, the poll creator can call the `ClosePoll` instruction to finalize the poll and update its status.
